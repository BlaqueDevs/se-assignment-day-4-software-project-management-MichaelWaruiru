  b. Competitive advantage
  
  c. Cost control
  
  d. Resource efficiency
### How project managers ensure deadlines are met
  a. Clear project scope and requirements
  
  b.Task prioritization and milestones
  
  c. Effective planning and scheduling
  
  d. Risk management
  
  e. Resource allocation
  
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
### How effective cost control contributes to software project success
  a. Financial stability

  b. Better resource management

  c.  Reduced risk of project failure

### Strategies to prevent budget overruns
  a. Clear scope definition

  b. Use Agile methodology

  c. Detailed project planning and budgeting

  d. Monitor and track costs regularly
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
  Agile is iterative and incremental while Waterfall is sequential and linear.
  
  Agile is highly flexible while Waterfall is rigid in structure.
### Advantages and disadvantages of each
#### Agile advantages
  Faster delivery

  Flexibility

  Improved quality

  Higher client satisfaction

#### Agile disadvantages
  Less predictability

  Requires active collaboration

  Documentation can lack

#### Waterfall advantages
  Clear structure
  
  Easy to manage

  Better for fixed budgets

  Well documented

#### Waterfall disadvantages
  Not flexible

  Late testing discovery

  High risk for unclear requirements
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
  Agile is best suited for projects with evolving requirements, rapid iterations and a need for continuous feedback. e.g SaaS development, Mobile app development, e-commerce platforms

  Waterfall is ideal projects with clearly defined requirements, minimal expected changes and strict compliance. e.g Government and regulatory compliance systems, healthcare software, banking and financial systems.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
### Methods for ensuring quality assurance
  a. Define clear quality standards and requirements
  
  b. Implement test-driven development
  
  c. CI/CD
  
  d. Automated testing

### Why maintaining high standards is important
  a. Enhances user experience
  
  b. Reduces long term costs

  c. Boosts security and compliance

  a. Clarity and alignment

  b. Prevention of scope creep

  c. Accurate resource allocation

  d. Better risk management

  Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is hierarchical decomposition  of a project into smaller manageable tasks. It's useful in project planning and scheduling, enhances team coordination, improves risk identification, enahnces progress tracking and facilitates better cost estimation.

  b. Clear task prioritization

  c. Better resource allocation

  d. Enahanced team cordination

### How Gantt Charts Assist in project sheduling
  A Gantt chart is a visual representation of a project schedule that shows tasks, durations and dependecies over time.
  Key benefits are: clear visual timeline, task dependencies, progress tracking, resource management.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
  Sacco Management system for PSVs where there is no centralized system to manage saccos, vehicles and drivers efficiently. The significance is helping sacco managers track vehicles, drivers and operations seemlessly, reducing fraud and improving accountability.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
  a. Guides development efforts

  b. Enhances user-centered design

  c. Improves resource allocation
